//! Positional indexer for cache-aware routing.
//!
//! Uses a single `DashMap<(usize, ContentHash), SeqEntry>` keyed by (position, content_hash).
//! No capacity limit — the map grows unboundedly as blocks are stored (matching Dynamo).
//! Jump search skips positions in strides, yielding amortized O(D/J + W) complexity.
//!
//! **Dual-hash scheme**: backends send a position-aware `block_hash` (SequenceHash)
//! and raw `token_ids` per block. The router computes a position-independent
//! ContentHash (XXH3) from token_ids, then a rolling prefix hash (also XXH3) from
//! the ContentHash sequence. SeqEntry is keyed by the router's prefix hash for
//! precise disambiguation at query time. The backend's SequenceHash is stored in
//! worker_blocks only, used for `apply_removed` reverse lookup.
//!
//! **Performance**: Internal u32 worker IDs eliminate Arc<str> hashing and atomic
//! refcount bouncing in the hot query loop. DashMap worker_blocks with no inner
//! RwLock eliminates contention. Atomic tree_sizes provide O(1) size queries.
//!
//! Thread safety: all methods are `&self` and internally synchronized via DashMap
//! sharding. No per-worker RwLock — worker_blocks entries are plain FxHashMaps
//! accessed through DashMap's shard-level locking.
